Your grade for the project milestone is 1. This means that you solved 1 boards
out of the 3 boards with which we tested the milestone (boards 131,132 and 133).

The requirements for E will be to solve a set of boards similar to board 131
( which was before board 2). These boads will have a number of walkable cells
similar to the board 130. Programming properly a depth first search with repeated
states detection should be enough to solve such a board.
For higher grades, you will have to solve a percent of a set of boards similar
in difficulty to boards 1-130 in the server. Solving 30,60,90,120 boards will
correspond to grades D,C,B,A. Your solver will have one minute to solve each
 board.
